Project 2: Habit Tracker
For this project, you will build a Django application that you can use to help track and reinforce daily habits.

Your application should have registration and login.
Users should be able to create a new habit tracker. Each habit should have a name and a target or goal. What is this "target"? Each habit should have a daily number of some action you want to do. Some examples:
I want to walk 1000 steps daily
I want to write 100 lines of code daily
I want to talk to 2 new people each day
I want to read 200 pages daily
I want to sleep 8 hours daily
Once you have habits, you should be able to make a daily record of your activity on each habit. That record should contain a date and a number for that date.
A user can only have one record per day per habit. You will need to use the unique_together option to enforce this.
Optimally, users can edit/update records and add records for previous days.
Make your interface for this feature as easy to use as possible. For example, if you can choose the date for your record, have it default to the current date.
On the detail page for a habit, you should be able to see all the records for that habit in an HTML table. Show the user whether they met their goal for that day visually somehow -- maybe via colors. Think about accessibility here -- how would a user that can't see know whether they met their goal each day?
